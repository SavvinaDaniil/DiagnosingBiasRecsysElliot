Welcome to the Diagnosing Bias in Recommender Systems - Elliot repository! In this project, we experiment with detecting bias in recommender systems, using the framework Elliot, and testing the DMF algorithm. By following the steps below, you can set up the environment and run the provided Jupyter notebooks to conduct popularity bias analysis.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Elliot project, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed:

- Python 3.8

## Installation

1. Create and activate a conda virtual environment:

   ```bash
   conda create --name elliotenv python=3.8
   conda activate elliotenv
   ```

2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SavvinaDaniil/Elliot.git
   cd Elliot
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
## Usage

Once you have completed the installation steps, you can now run the bias analysis experiment using the provided Jupyter notebook.

1. Start the Jupyter notebook server:

   ```bash
   
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Make sure that jupyter points to the jupyter installed from the requirements file. You may need to deactivate and activate the environment again.

2. Open the notebooks from the project directory. Each notebook performs a different process by calling the appropriate widget. You can select which dataset you wish to perform the process on.
